# JavaScriptSimpleProjects
This is a collection of some JavaScript to learn and revise by viewing
Each folder contains the same logic exercise, but each one represents the approach by its name:
### 1-XMLHttpRequest
### 2-fetch
### 3-AJAX
### 4-axios

The backend for checking the operations such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE is json-server
...
So if you download the following exercises, make sure json-server is installed globally
on your machine....
just a reminder...
Thanks :)
